<p>BioRomeo is a collective of organic farmers who work together to bring their produce to you:
straight from the farmer, grown with love, fresh and delicious fruit and vegetables.
They do this through “vegetable clubs” like Organic Campus, but also through restaurants, local markets and even directly through their webshop.
<p>For more info, visit their <a href="www.bioromeo.nl">website</a> .</p>
