Hi, we are the current board of Organic Campus. We take care of all the bi-weekly orders and organize the bigger events. Every Monday we have a meeting to make sure everything will go smoothly and to share our passion for good, organic food. This spring we organized two dinner events and a farmerâ€™s market and we created this website. Before summer we will welcome some new board members as Isobel, Suzanne and Wendy will be saying goodbye.
